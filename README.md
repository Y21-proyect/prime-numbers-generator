Easy tool to made a list of prime numbers.

First version was slow for upper 10.000 prime numbers.
The new version can do prime number 400 times more bigger than last one with a new algoritm. And itÂ´s faster. 


version 3.0 include a menu. You can select about how many prime numbers do you want or obtain prime numbers near a value.
In this version you have two options:

If you select to made an exactly prime numbers, and are more than 10.000 numbers, depending of power of your machine, it will be slow.
If you select to made a list of prime numbers near 10.000 it will be fast. It is because i created a different algoritm for boths options.

Made a good use, world need peace and love.
