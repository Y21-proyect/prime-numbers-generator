Easy tool to made a list of prime numbers.

version 3.0 include a menu. You can select about how many prime numbers do you want or obtain prime numbers near a value.

In this version you have two options:

If you select to made an exactly prime numbers, and are more than 10.000 numbers, depending of power of your machine, it will be slow.
If you select to made a list of prime numbers near 10.000 it will be fast. It is because i created a different algoritm for this option.

Made a good use, worl need peace and love.
